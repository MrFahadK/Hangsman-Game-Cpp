# Hangsman-Game-Cpp
This repository features a console-based Hangman game implemented in C++. Players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the current state of the word and remaining attempts.
